## About
This repository mainly collects good articles from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com). I use this repo to keep original articles and Chinese translations both in markdown format.

## Article filename convention
- PartI:    added date
- PartII:   title
- PartIII:  language
- PartIV:   author

For example: 20180905-how-to-teach-yourself-hard-things-en-by-julia-evans

Here **20180905** is date, **How to teach yourself hard things** is article title, **en** is language in English, and **Julia Evans** is author's name.
